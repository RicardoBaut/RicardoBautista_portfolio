One main issue at loading files into a sql database are that sometimes the files that we want to add to our db are multiple tables,
it could be exhausting and time-consuming at creating an schema for every table that we want to add to our db and then loading the information into each table
one at the time, sometimes it's better to automate this process using programming, specifically there are python's librarirs that can help us at 
manipualting SQL objects.

The following it's the code used to loading all the csv files files within a folder and importing their data into new tables, all in the same code:

import os
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Database connection details
engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postcoco:V1398@localhost/Olympics')

# Path to your folder containing CSV files
folder_path = r'C:\\Users\\ricar\\OneDrive\\Escritorio\\PROJECTS\\SQL_Olympics\\DATASET\\CSVs'

# Loop through all CSV files in the folder
for file in os.listdir(folder_path):
    if file.endswith('.csv'):  # Ensures only CSV files are processed
        file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file)

        # Load the CSV into a pandas DataFrame
        df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

        # Use the filename (or a custom name) as the table name
        table_name = file.split('.')[0]

        # Write data to PostgreSQL
        df.to_sql(table_name, engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
        print(f"Imported {file} into {table_name}")
